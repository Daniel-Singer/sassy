# SASSY - a small SCSS framework

This is my try on creating some reusable styles for the webapps iÂ´m building. Pretty much everything is based on Material Design.

## The elements i styled so far

* Units
  - Margins
  - Paddings
  - Heights
  - Widths

Every unit can be changed individually and it will affect all components and the whole styling. So no need to worry that the measurements of some elements will be off.

* Typography
  - Font
  - Font sizes
  - Letter spacing
  - Line heights

Based on Material Designs guidelines for typography.

* Buttons
  - Full buttons
  - Text buttons
  - Outlined buttons
  - Hover effects
  - Ripple animation

The buttons can be sized individually with different classes

* Containers
  - Set the width of a container
  - Set the margin with the mg classes
